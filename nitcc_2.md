# Visit of the Fangorn Forest

One of the point of `nitcc` is to generate the classes of the AST and visit methods.
You can look around in the generated files.

Let's focus on the Logolas format.

There is an abstract cursor (At√πin in Elfish) that start at (0,0) and that point to the right (because elves like to be right).

There is 3 basic types of commands:

* forward (`‚≠°`) is used to advance in the current direction, the distance is given by the followin number (from 1 to 12).
  Because elves like purty, the final position must be rounded to the nearest integer for x an y. It means that between commands, the turtle is always at an integer position.
* turn left (`‚Æ¢`) and right (`‚Æ£`) change the current direction.
  The angle is given from 1 to 12 like in a clock (3 means a right angle). 
* sequence enclosed betwwen `ùÑÜ` and `ùÑá` are repeated a given number of times indicated after the closing `ùÑá`.
  Note that `‚Ö§` repetitions means that the sequence must be executed 6 times.

## Mission

Using the classes generated by nitcc, implement a program that computes the final position of the At√πin. The logolas file is given as the first argument of the program.

To help you, three logolas files are proposed:

* an elegant an abstract L letter <maenas.logolas>. Expected result is `(0,3)`
* a glowing and inpiring star <elen.logolas>. Expected result is `(10, -3)`
* a peasible and warm house <bar.logolas>. Expected result is `(4, 0)`
