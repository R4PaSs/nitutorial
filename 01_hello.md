# Hello, World!

Nit is a statically typed language that aims at elegance, simplicity and intuitiveness.

For instance, `print` is a function that print something at the screen

~~~nit
print "I print therefore I am."
~~~

In fact, `print` is a method from the core library that accepts any kind of objects and prints a human-readable form to standard output; but these concept will be introduced latter.

## Exercise

Write a Nit program that output the traditional *Hello, World!*

~~~nit
print "Something, Something!"
~~~
